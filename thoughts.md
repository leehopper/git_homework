I want to master keyboard shortcuts so I no longer rely upon my mouse/trackpad.
Git is a lot to learn, and I need to "commit" to practicing it.

I am committed to not using my mouse while working on the technical portion of my homework/project.
I am committed to taking notes in advance and using colors and other suggested organizational strategies to see how it works for me.
