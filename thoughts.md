I want to stay committed to mastering the keyboard shortcuts so I no longer have to rely on the mouse/trackpad.

I am committed to taking notes in advance and using colors and other suggested organizational strategies to see how it works for me.

Someone who's supported me along the way: my wife Natalie!

New thoughts for session project: git and github are getting easier the more I use them.
